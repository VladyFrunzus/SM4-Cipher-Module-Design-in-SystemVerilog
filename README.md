# SM4-Cipher-Module-Design-in-SystemVerilog
This is my bachelor's paper thesis which I defended at the Politehnica University of Bucharest. It consists of the design of a digital module, for encryption and decryption of data of any size, utilizing the SM4 Block Cipher.

The repository contains all the design sources required for the entire project to run in Vivado, as well as the project thesis, in Romanian.
